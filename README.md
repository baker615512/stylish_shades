# Stylish Shades

This app allows shoppers to purchase sunglasses with the click of a button.

## Framework

I created the back end using Rails API and RESTful conventions. The front end is developed with plain Javascript and styled with CSS and Bootstrap.

## Installation

You can fork and clone this app with the respective buttons above. After running `open index.html` in your terminal, you will be redirected to localhost:3000 in your Internet browser.
